### Purpose
A way to uplift small scale farmers and encourage them to grow.

### PROBLEM AND APPROACH
- The food demand-to-resources imbalance is getting wider as the population grows.
- In 2050, the world would need to produce 70% more food than it does now, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

### SOLUTION
- Increase the number of farmers to increase food output.
- Reduce waste brought on by ineffective farming techniques

### OUR APPROACH
Our approach towards solving this problem is by increasing the amount of people who create food in order to improve productivity. Reduce the amount of waste that results from inefficient farming operations. Through our application, gardeners and farmers of all sizes can easily keep track of upcoming events, research agricultural techniques, find solutions to their questions, and streamline their operations.
