AED Final Project- Fall 2022
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The disparity between the amount of food that needs to be produced and the amount of agricultural resources is growing as a result of population growth. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that by the year 2050, the global population would require 70 percent more food than is now produced. Our approach towards solving this problem is by increasing the amount of people who create food in order to improve productivity. Reduce the amount of waste that results from inefficient farming operations.
